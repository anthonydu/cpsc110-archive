(@problem 1)

(@htdd 1String)
;; 1String is String
;; interp. a 1String represents a single letter
;; CONSTRAINT: any 1String is only one letter long

(@htdd ListOf1String)
;; ListOf1String is one of:
;; - empty
;; - (cons 1String ListOf1String)
;; interp. a sequence of letters

(define L1 empty)
(define L2 (list "a" "B" "c"))

(@htdd Operations)
;; Operations is one of:
;; - empty
;; - (cons "keep" Operations)
;; - (cons "space" Operations)
;; - (cons "remove" Operations)
;; interp. a sequence of operations to apply to a list of 1String
;;         "keep"   means keep    the corresponding letter
;;         "space"  means replace the corresponding letter with a " "
;;         "remove" means remove  the corresponding letter

;;
;; In this problem you will design a function called decoder, that will
;; decode encrypted messages! Very poorly encrypted messages.  The function
;; consumes a ListOf1String (l) and Operations (ops) in that order. The
;; function should produce a String which is the result of applying the
;; given operations to the successive 1String and joining the resulting
;; letters together.
;;
;; For example:
;; (decoder (list "i" "k" "l" "h" "a" "m" "k" "s" "a" "r" "m")
;;          (list "keep" "remove" "remove" "space" "keep" "keep"
;;                "space" "keep" "keep" "remove"))
;;
;; should produce "i am sam"
;;
;; Notice that some of the letters were kept, some were replaced with a space,
;; and some were removed.
;; 
;; If ops runs out of operations before the end of the 1String, then all 
;; the remaining letters in l are kept.
;;
;; If l runs out of 1String first, then the remaining operations in ops are
;; ignored.
;;
;; Example 2:
;; (decoder (list "f" "a" "d" "e")
;;          (list "remove" "keep" "space" "keep" "remove" "keep" "space"))
;;
;; should produce "a e"
;;

;; You MUST SOLVE THIS AS A 2-ONE-OF PROBLEM and your solution must include
;; a table. You must use numbers to show the correspondence between table cells
;; and cond QA pairs. By this, we mean you should NUMBER the table cells and
;; NUMBER the corresponding cond QA pairs with the same numbers (as was done
;; in lecture). If you can simplify the table you should.  Finally, it is
;; IMPERATIVE that your cond questions only include the kinds of questions that 
;; the data driven template rules produce, other conditional behaviour must go
;; into the cond answers. (This is the rule about not editing template questions
;; carried over into 2-one-of problems.)
